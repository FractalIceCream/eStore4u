  ## Description
  
  This application is a back-end app for e-commerce utilizing mysql server to perform CRUD operations. Utilizing express, sequelize, and mysql2, we can implement Models for our data and make CRUD associatedAPI calls. We connect to the mysql server and initialize the database. Then we can start by seeding the data and run the server. The Insomnia application allows us to make all CRUD http calls and perform operations for Product/Tag/Category tables.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
